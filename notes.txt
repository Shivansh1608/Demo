
Hello, my name is Shivansh Gupta, and I am a passionate learner and aspiring software developer from India. I come from a culturally rich background and have always been deeply fascinated by the power of technology and how it impacts our daily lives. My academic background is in Computer Science, which has fueled my interest in software development and programming. I enjoy working with various programming languages and tools, particularly in the area of full-stack web development. I specialize in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap to design visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. On the backend, I have hands-on experience with Node.js and Express.js and am currently improving my skills in the MERN stack. I strongly believe that practical learning through real-world projects is the best way to grow, which is why I have developed multiple web projects, including e-commerce platforms, health monitoring systems, online booking apps, and interactive games. One of my proudest projects is HerHealth+, a comprehensive womenâ€™s wellness platform that includes health report tracking, appointment booking, a medicine store, and more.
